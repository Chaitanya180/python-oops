    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines a set of properties and methods that a particular type of object can have. An object is an instance of a class, created using the class blueprint, that has specific values assigned to its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to create a class for a car. The class would define the properties of a car such as color, make, model, and year. The class would also define methods, such as drive() and stop(), which can be performed on the car. Once the class is defined, we can create objects of the car class with specific values for each property. For example, we can create an object of the car class named my_car with a red color, a make of Toyota, a model of Camry, and a year of 2021."

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world, and exposing only the necessary properties and methods for external use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of modeling complex real-world systems using simpler, more generalized concepts. It allows us to focus on the essential features of a system, while ignoring the irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on existing classes. Inheritance allows new classes to inherit the properties and methods of existing classes, and to add or override them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. It allows us to write more flexible and generic code, and to create code that can work with a variety of different types of objects.\n"
